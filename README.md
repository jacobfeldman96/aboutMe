# About Me

Hi! My name is Jacob and welcome to my GitHub! I am a blockchain developer and I've recently completed the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies Fintech Bootcamp Certificate as well as the DApp University Blockchain Bootcamp Certificate. 

Feel free to take a look around. I am very interested in DeFi and am working on creating a few DeFi Exchanges with my investment partnership, Cryptonite Technologies. Repos to come... In the meantime, feel free to fork any codebase you'd like and if you like what you see, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmcfeldman/)! Thanks :-)
